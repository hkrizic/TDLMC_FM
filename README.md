# TDLMC_FM
TDLMC_FM is a modular forward-modelling (FM) and Bayesian inference pipeline developed for the Time-Delay Lens Modelling Challenge (TDLMC). It provides a unified framework to perform, benchmark, and compare probabilistic lens inference using Nautilus (nested sampling), built on top of the Herculens lens-modelling library.
